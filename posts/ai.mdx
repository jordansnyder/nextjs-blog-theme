# The tsunami is here, it's real, and it's not going away.

LLMs, LVMs, and their counterparts have reached a level of maturity where they are no longer in the arena of early adopters and bot-huggers, but very real, very useful tools.

## We have a moral imperative to figure out how this changes economics
There is no question that this changes everything from manufacturing to automotive to marketng and advertising. What is not clear quite yet is what impact this will have on our workforce. If history is any guide, new technological innovations
will lead to more jobs eventually, but the idea that every person working in a coal plant is going to become a vibe coder is absolutely absurd and baseless. So while we MAY see net job creation and growth, the more important part of the story
is the heavy, sudden disruption of the job market, in an economic system that prioritizes profit over quite literally everything else. Our modern flavor of (hyper)capitalism has never seemed more inadequate than the present time.

## Creativity will continue to explode
Despite the hype and the haters, millions of people are utilizing AI every day in many different ways - there is a real, pragmatic value here. Most people are familiar with the AI slop, the AI-generated photos and videos on social media, 
all the self-proclaimed "AI Experts" on LinkedIn. It can all get pretty sickening, especially to those of us who've been around technology for a few decades. But the reality is that the best craftspeople - artists, coders, designers, 
3D modelers and animators, etc are using generative AI tools and you just don't know it. Because these folks are still crafting. AI is a tool, and it requires skilled craftspeople to make something that's actually GOOD. And that's the way it
should be.

## Energy issues are valid, but it has always been inevitable that we will continue to consume more energy
I lived completely off-grid for 2 years on my own 30-acre property in New Mexico. I had solar panels, batteries, an inverter, etc and I had to maintain them over time. I love "clean" energy. It just makes sense to me - we have this insanely
bright star at the center of our solar system, so let's use it. It should last us much longer than the carbon from all the flora and fauna (mostly flora) that we have to pump out of the ground. But we need to be realistic about human patterns 
around energy usage. Insert law here's Law came from patterns noticed over several periods of technological innovation - any time we developed energy-saving technologies, we end up consuming more energy because we're more excited about the 
efficiencies that we gained and we want to put it to use. The result is a net increase in energy consumption, and the truth is that we can never put the genie back in the bottle unless we are forced to do so through catastrophe and lost knowledge, 
infrastructure, tools, etc.
