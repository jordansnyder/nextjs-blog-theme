## In "What You Do is Who You Are," Ben Horowitz talks about company culture and why it's so important. 

# Culture isn't just an ingrained set of rules, it's a structured system built on behaviors that people are expected to follow.

## Be yourself at all times, but know your strengths and weaknesses.
- Model the behavior you want to see - lead by example.
- Look to new hires. Imagine your ideal employees, and look to hire those people.
  - Smart, with a desire to learn
  - Humble - stay focused and become the person people want to work with
  - Hardworking, competitive, determined
  - Collaborative - provide leadership and take responsibility
- Be specific about the virtues you want to see.
- A few bad eggs can turn the culture upside down
  - The Heretic - looks for faults in the company and spreads it to others
  - The Flake - smart but cannot be relied upon. 
  - The Jerk - terrible with communication, fails to accept criticism
  - The Prophet of Rage -
