# Culture isn't just an ingrained set of rules, it's a structured system built on behaviors that people are expected to follow.

 In "What You Do is Who You Are," Ben Horowitz talks about company culture and why it's so important.

## Be yourself at all times, but know your strengths and weaknesses.
If a leader is kind, empathetic, forgiving and "soft," but they try to act like the cold disciplinarian, the incongruity of their actions will be apparent. 
Don't try to be someone you're not. The right people will not take advantage of you, and even kind people can develop strategies and habits that demand respect even from the less forgiving kinds of people.

## Follow a code of honor and maintain integrity

Horowitz reminds us of the Bushido code, which is something that can inspire just about anyone. 
- Integrity (Gi)
- Respect (Rei)
- Heroic Courage (Yu)
- Honor (Meiyo)
- Compassion (Jin)
- Honesty & Sincerity (Makoto)
- Duty & Loyalty (Chu)

## Model the behavior you want to see - lead by example.

## Build the culture with the right people. Imagine your ideal employees, and look to hire those people.
  - Smart, with a desire to learn
  - Humble - stay focused and become the person people want to work with
  - Hardworking, competitive, determined
  - Collaborative - provide leadership and take responsibility

## Be specific about the virtues you want to see.

## A few bad eggs can turn the culture upside down
  - The Heretic - looks for faults in the company and spreads it to others
  - The Flake - smart but cannot be relied upon. 
  - The Jerk - terrible with communication, fails to accept criticism
  - The Prophet of Rage - 

## The culture boils down to the people & their behaviors
See a pattern? A company is only as good as its culture, and a culture is only as good as its people and their actions.
It's easy to see, but can be challenging to maintain. The principles provided above are a good starting point to having a great company or team culture.
