Jordan is a multi-faceted leader of creative and technical innovators with 25 years of experience in advertising, design/technology consulting, startups, Fortune 500/100 companies, immersive art, themed entertainment, and film.

As both a creative and technical person, she finds inspiration at the intersection of technology, art, business, and entrepreneurship. She seeks to inspire and lead teams of diverse and innovative folks to build next-generation transformative experiences, products, and platforms.
